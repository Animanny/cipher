# Contribution Guidelines

This document contains guidelines to contributing to Cipher's repository. If you disagree with something here, [open up an issue](https://github.com/projectcipher/cipher/issues/new)!

## GitHub Workflow

Our workflow follows closely to the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Though, instead of deploying from a reviewed pull request, we merge first and deploy straight from master.

Part of the GitHub Flow is submitting pull requests. See https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ for a good overview of what pull requests are and how to use them.

## Branch Names and File Names

Branch names should:

- Be lowercase
- Use `-` as a separator (as oppose to a space)

Files names should:

- Be lowercase
- Use `_` as a separator (as oppose to a space)

## Commits

This allows our history to make sense.

### 1. Follow the Commit Message Guidelines

These are the guidelines:

- Write in the imperative mood
- Start with a capital letter
- _Do not_ end with a period

#### Example

> Add headings to each section

### 2. Each Commit Should Contain One Completed Task

A commit should consist of the completion of one task, not several.

#### Example

> Add detail to section five, fix typos

Each of the two changes should be split into one commit.

> Add detail to section five

> Fix typos
