------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About

Cipher is a code-oriented community in the  [Peel Region](https://www.peelregion.ca). We run Circles, a weekly meetup for selected high schoolers, workshops across Peel, and [Campfire](http://campfire.projectcipher.io).

We plan to do some dope stuff in the future with our content, but right now we're mostly focussed on building out and testing a ton of stuff this first year.

## Guides

We have a ton of step-by-step guides we are working on adding/creating to help you create some sweet things.

The plan is to create playlists with several guides to create a sort of curriculum. We want to take a modular approach to this. Our goals is to make this as well-documented as possible.

## Want to Help?

Cipher is currently being built by an average description of a team in Silicon Valley: three brown guys and one asian.
