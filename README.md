# Guides

[Cipher](http://projectcipher.io) is a launchpad into code. This our collection of guides that will introduce you to programming!

Guides are lessons that help familiarize you with new coding concepts.

Each of Cipher's guides take about an hour, with a focus on project-based learning. From our experience, the best way to learn to code is to build & ship projects.

Detailed explanations, examples, and practice exercises can be found in [`DOCUMENTATION`](guides/DOCUMENTATION.md), where a focus is put on the fundamental concepts.
